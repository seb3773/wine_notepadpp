# wine_notepadpp
notepad++ wine installation.  

This is a notepad++ (x64+32) installer for linux, with the help of wine :)  
The installer was designed for q4os trinity, but should work on any recent debian distro (maybe with some adjustements to the .desktop files).  
  
Instructions:  
  
clone the repository, an cd to the wine_notepadpp folder
set install_notepadpp.sh executable: sudo chmod +x ./install_notepadpp.sh
launch the installer: ./install_notepadpp.sh
Enjoy.
